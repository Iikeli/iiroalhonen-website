# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

I finally got my first iOS job in December 2020, while spending the better part of a year focusing my learnings into Swift and the Apple ecosystem. In this post I'll share a bit of my own background followed by what I did, what I focused on, and what I would have done differently in the job search process. I will also share numbers and statistics I collected along the way.

## Background

I've always been interested in computers, gaming, and building things. It took me quite a long time to realize that programming combines these fields and could be a profession I would enjoy.

When I was in elementary school, I would spend most of my time playing video games and trying out interesting 'things' on the computer. This broad pool of 'things' basically meant computer hacks that would amuse me and my friends. For example, I would write text based adventure games that were played in the command line. Or, I would write small shell scripts to rotate the screen orientation and open the CD-drive every minute or so, which I would then install in school computers and make it run on start up. Now that I think of it, the IT person at my school probably hated me.

Still, it took me a few years after graduating from high school to realise that programming is a valid profession and even something I would enjoy doing every day. In 2016 I started my studies in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland (where I am from). My major was in software engineering with a specialization in back-end development in Java.

I was excited to be programming but unfortunately I found Java less than ideal. So I started filling my free time doing simple webpages with JavaScript (if you are not familiar with programming languages, Java and JavaScript are not related at all). I enjoyed working in the front-end and focused my efforts there, while also goofing around in Unity, a popular game engine.

After a year and a half of studying, I got my first programming job during the summer break. The job was at a small Finnish startup called 'Zapflow' and my title was 'Junior Software Developer'. I worked with Clojure and was doing mostly testing. I learned a good amount about working in a Scrum team, but looking back at the time, I should have pushed myself more to understand the code and ask more (dumb) questions from my coworkers.

After that summer job, I went back to school for about six months before finding my second programming job at a company working on a taxation and pension system. This was my first time at a big company, and I was excited to dive deeper into code and help build the system. Sadly, due to poor infrastructure and bureaucracy, I wrote 0 lines of code in 3 months and reinstalled windows ~10 times. This company was not for me, so I moved on.

In March of 2018, I joined the startup 'Basemark' as their first full time QA Engineer. After experiencing work at a big company, I was excited to work at a startup again! I really felt like I was a meaningful part of the team, making the product better through testing. The team was great and 90% of the employees were great graphics programmers who had such deep understanding of the field that I was astonished every day talking to them. During this time I dropped out of university… well I was kicked out, because I was no longer taking any classes. But that didn't really matter to me, I was working full time. After a couple of years in Basemark, I tried to transfer towards mobile front-end development. We even made plans with the team lead to get me working on the mobile app and we were hoping to hire a Junior QA Engineer to take over the testing. Sadly, this did not work out and I had to leave the company in July 2020.

After that I spent my time working on my own projects and a couple of months in another Helsinki based startup called Stealth Black as a Software Developer, working with React and Python, before finally finding my first iOS job here in Bremen, Germany. But how did that happen?

## The Job Hunt

### The Reason

In late 2019, I got frustrated about not doing any creative work in code. Yes, I worked with some amount of code every day, but I was mostly doing manual testing. I tried to remind myself that QA and testing would be short term and that it was a way to get into the industry. But here I was having worked in testing for two years and more than ready to get back into development.

I knew that I wanted to dive deep into a subject, so I could achieve the depth of knowledge that my colleagues in Basemark had. So I did some thinking, I read articles, and tried to figure out what field I wanted to focus on. I thought about making games, I thought about websites, even fell into the data science rabbit hole for a bit. Then I started to play around with Swift. After all, I always liked to create things and with me having an iPhone in my pocket and a MacBook on my desk, I could build my own apps that I wanted to use! So I began to focus on Swift and iOS development.

### The Plan

At this point I was still at Basemark, and I had hopes that I would be able to do cross platform mobile development in JavaScript. I had done some Android development in school, but didn't find it too enjoyable, so in my free time I was focusing on Swift and SwiftUI. The plan at this time was to keep learning Swift, SwiftUI, and have a basic understanding of UIKit. Since SwiftUI was not used in production yet but Apple was clearly making a push towards the new framework, everyone was starting to learn it. I would learn SwiftUI outside of work and become knowledgeable with the framework, while still learning some UIKit. This meant that I was able to apply for iOS jobs whenever I saw an interesting one.

After I left Basemark, however, I was able to focus on the job hunt full time. I started focusing more on UIKit, because it was widely used in the field. My focus shifted into a wider field of positions than before, because I no longer had the safety of a regular paycheck. This body runs on burritos, coffee and cookies, and providing those essential nutrients requires income.

### The Search

My main channel for finding jobs was LinkedIn. I started by turning on alerts for iOS jobs globally. Additionally, when a cool company would have postings for mobile or front-end developers, I would send an application there too. Like I said, my net was wide. All of that free time had me in the zone! I was practising my coding and looking at job postings for hours every day. Sometimes I would send up to 10 applications a day, sometimes I wouldn't find anything interesting the whole week.

Through out it all, I focused on finding companies and positions that genuinely interested me and where I felt I would learn the most. It was also important that I find a healthy and supportive company culture where employees are encouraged to learn and improve their skills.

After a bit over a year of looking for an iOS Developer position, I found one. Or I guess I could say, they found me.

## Statistics

So all of that was about a years worth of job searching, but how does that look in numbers?

### What Positions I Applied For

I sent **286 applications in total**. Of those applications…
* **219 of which were iOS developer positions**
* 6 were general mobile developer positions
* 15 were front-end developer positions
* 46 were open applications

### How I Applied

* 188 of the applications were through LinkedIn
* 8 through MeetFrank
* 2 through StackOverflow
* 82 were applied to with cold emails
* 2 of the positions I found out through a friend working at the company
* And I was head hunted for the last 4

### Where I Applied

There are many countries that I applied to, the ones I will list here are the ones I sent more than 10 applications to.

* 40 positions in the Netherlands
* 39 positions in Germany (2 remote positions)
* 34 positions in United Kingdom
* 30 positions in Spain (1 remote position)
* 22 positions in Finland (1 remote position)
* 21 positions in Belgium
* 13 positions in the United States of America
* 10 positions in Italy
* 32 remote position. These were specifically 100% remote, no restrictions on time zones or need to come to the office every once and awhile.

## Results (we know this is what you're really here for)

Of the 286 applications I sent, I got 74 rejections. So **under 75%** of the companies I applied to **never replied**. Even worse, 58 of those rejections were automated responses. To be clear, **only 5.6% of the companies sent a personalised rejection email**. Those number are astonishingly low.

On the positive side, I did have 15 interviews, got 5 take-home projects, and rejected 2 companies myself (both because of a laughably low pay offer. Know your worth, people!). Additionally, when asking for feedback after interviews, I got some 28% of the time.

Then finally, in November 2020, after 2 interviews and one pair programming session, I signed my contract with KPS Software in Bremen, Germany. This was one of the jobs I was headhunted for, and the recruiter admittedly did a lot of the leg work for me. But I moved countries for work, and was excited because it was something I always wanted to do. Plus I've always liked Germany as a country. **Side note: moving during a global pandemic was not the easiest. It will not make it to the list of my recommendations.**

## Findings

Companies are terrible at replying to applicants and updating their open job listings. That is clear. That being said, there are plenty of exceptions that will stay in my mind as good places to recommend (Bunq, Ka-ching, and Trivago, to name a few). There were also companies whose processes were extremely painful, and who I will not recommend to anyone.

Just keep in mind, if you want to find a job that fits you and your needs, it's going to take time. Also, if you don't have experience in programming, you might need to think about different ways to get that initial experience. I had my first experience in the field with QA and testing. It gave me knowledge on how teams work and what it takes to release a product, both very valuable things to know, but it wasn't my end goal. Just a stepping stone, and every stepping stone leads you forward in some way or another.

## Things You Can Do

### Write Blog Posts

First of all, diving deep into subjects or problems and writing about them is a great way to learn. That's why I'm here writing this. People tend to also hire people they know. So if a developer has been having the same problem that you had, and you solved it and wrote a blog post about it, they will already have a good idea of what you can do. If the developer is involved in the hiring process, you already have an advantage.

### Be Active

Like I said, people hire the people they know. Being active on Twitter or in local meet ups is a great way to get to know people, as well as give them the chance to get to know you. From this, you might get hints about job opportunities that never get posted in job boards, or in the future these people might be looking for work when your company has an opening and you'll have a chance to help them out.

### Keep Learning

What ever you do, don't stop learning. This is the only way to grow and get better. There are many ways of learning, I like listening to podcasts (my favorite is Fireside Swift), watching videos (many thanks to Sean Allen and Paul Hudson), and reading blog posts.

Not sure what you should be learning? A great way to know what is needed in the field is by looking at job postings. Multiple job postings require you to know Combine? Then you should probably learn that. Another great way to learn things is to look at common interview questions and figure out how you would answer them. I'm not saying learn them by heart, but actually gain an understanding on the subject. Interviewers can tell if you just memorized the answers to commonly asked questions, but if you can have a conversation on the subject because you understand it, that's valuable.

### Build Something

This is the most important step and I cannot emphasise this enough. If you want to build apps for a living, build an app in your free time and publish it! I did that myself in 2020, and I have learned so much from it. Not sold on the idea? Well think about it this way: you wouldn't trust a tattoo artist that hasn't done tattoos. This is the same thing.

### Don't Be Too Hard On Yourself

It's easy to get caught up thinking that you are not doing enough. Looking at social media, you see developers who publish multiple articles a week, while also maintaining popular apps and a YouTube channel. People like sharing their success stories, but most never share their mistakes. Remember, you only see the successes, rarely the mistakes and the work it took to get there.

That was my experience on finding my first position in the iOS Development world. It certainly was a ride, but now I am writing Swift code every day and I have not felt this motivated at work in a while.
Hope this post helps people realize that it takes time to find a job you want. I hope you gained some information or got inspired by this post. If you have any questions, you can post them in the comments or send me a message on Twitter.

Now go build something and share it with me!
